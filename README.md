## Overview
Using the [eBird API](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/CLOISAPI/eBird+API+1.1) and the [Leaflet JavaScript library and/or API](http://leafletjs.com/), we plan to give our users the opportunity to compare regions to one another relative to the birds that are sited in those areas.  Due to the richness of the eBird API, the UI will be heavily influenced by what the API has to offer, but we also want to prepare ourselves to allow other APIs to be used besides the eBird API.

## Technology
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- Heroku
- Bootstrap
- Jade
- JQuery

## Learning
- eBird API
- Leaflet API
- UI Design
- data visualization
- in-person and remote teamwork

## Milestones
1. Build routes to eBird API endpoints and respond with JSON.
2. Build routes to Leaflet API endpoints.
3. Build templates for data visualization.
4. Build UI interface that allows user to manipulate comparison criteria according to parameters available in various APIs.

## Responsibilities
Milestones will be broken up into tasks and divvied up across the team.  However, we look forward to supporting each other in our tasks to help move the project forward.  The team will consider the need to task out each milestone in detail enough to warrent the use of a kanban board or similar tool to help the team tackle tasks in an efficient manner.
